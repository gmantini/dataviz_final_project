The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course. .




## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find an analysis on the distribution of births in the United States
from the years 2000-2014. Results showed that there are much fewer births on weekends compared to weekdays, likely as a result of planned/scheduled births and hospital staffing costs. For likely similar reasons, there were also significantly fewer births on holidays such as January 1st, July 4th, December 24th/25th, as well as the range of dates spanning the week of Thanksgiving from ~November 22nd to the 28th in any given year. 

Summer months have notably higher numbers of births, likely due to natural seasonal conditions with more babies being conceived in cold winter months. There is also a notably slight dropoff in births starting from the 2007-08 year, perhaps due to the finanical criss and a change in culture. While having leveled out in recent years, this can still be seen as a slight stagnation in births with the relative increase in population.

## Project 02

Inspired by the R4DS Tidy Tuesday work, I explored the distribution of Nobel Laureate Winners and Publications from the inception of the prize in 1901 through 2016. Conclusions of the analysis were that Nobel Prizes were predominantly won by men in the United States and Europe who are in their late 60s. 

In addition, the work they won an award for on average was published ~25 years prior to receiving their allocade. This winning publication on average occurs 20% of the way in to their career. These trends are most pronounced in the Sciences, while Peace and Literature Prizes have more variation in age and birth country. 

Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder.
