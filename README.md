The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course. .




## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find an analysis on the distribution of births in the United States
from the years 2000-2014. Results showed that there are much fewer births on weekends compared to weekdays, likely as a result of planned/scheduled births and hospital staffing costs. For likely similar reasons, there were also significantly fewer births on holidays such as January 1st, July 4th, December 24th/25th, as well as the range of dates spanning the week of Thanksgiving from ~November 22nd to the 28th in any given year. 

Summer months have notably higher numbers of births, likely due to natural seasonal conditions with more babies being conceived in cold winter months. There is also a notably slight dropoff in births starting from the 2007-08 year, perhaps due to the finanical criss and a change in culture. While having leveled out in recent years, this can still be seen as a slight stagnation in births with the relative increase in population.

## Project 02

Inspired by the R4DS Tidy Tuesday work, I explored the distribution of Nobel Laureate Winners and Publications from the inception of the prize in 1901 through 2016. Conclusions of the analysis were that Nobel Prizes were predominantly won by men in the United States and Europe who are in their late 60s. 

In addition, the work they won an award for on average was published ~25 years prior to receiving their allocade. This winning publication on average occurs 20% of the way in to their career. These trends are most pronounced in the Sciences, while Peace and Literature Prizes have more variation in age and birth country. 

Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder.

## Project 03

In `project_03/`, I explored methods to visualize text data using the Billboards Top 100 dataset from 2015. I specifically focused on analyzing the top 100 songs through the AFINN lexicon. The AFINN lexicon is a list of words manually rated with an integer between -5 (negative) and +5 (positive) for its sentiment.

### Moving Forward

Through my experience in the Data Visualization and Reproducible Research course, I learned and reinforced a number of important concepts in the field of data analytics and data science. This was the first time I learned how to produce spacial visualizations, and having that demystified will help me a lot moving forward to start to better implement geographic data. Seeing the interactive data stories/articles also gave me some good insight and ideas for more effective and captivating data storytelling. 

Lastly, getting a refresher on version control through github and learning about special YAML attributes for integrating markdown in github from RStudio was a nice touch for better showcasing my work. Overall, I look forward to better integrating these core concepts in to my future work in my Master's Project, as well as in industry or any related side projects I may end up doing.
